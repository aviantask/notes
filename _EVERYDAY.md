# Wisdom requiring daily reminders
## Learning
One: skills take time and effort to master. Two: most things aren't fun until you're good at them.

Use the 80/20 principle to find the most important information. Then embed it with a project.

Consistency is king. Forget about motivation and willpower, they don't work. Commit to tiny goals every day, and do them regardless of how you feel. Remember that a 1% improvement every tick will take 72 ticks to double.
